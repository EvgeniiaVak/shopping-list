# shopping-list

Simplest app I could think of to study Redis. Inspired by book [Redis in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/redis-in-action) and daily use of google keep and desire to add new features there.

Created items are stored in the unchecked list (nothing new here). New features are in the set of already bought items (duplicates are deleted, set is kept short).
